Recently launched Virtual Assistant products such as Amazon Echo and Google Home are commanded by voice and can call apps to do simple tasks like setting timers and playing music. The next-generation virtual assistants will recommend things to be done proactively rather than waiting for commands passively. This project aims to develop algorithms that can predict what a user intends to do and therefore help virtual assistants make recommendations that suit usersâ€™ needs accurately. It will benefit many service industry sectors of Australia by enabling virtual assistants to provide services proactively.
