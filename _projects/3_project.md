The aim of the project is to leverage AI algorithms and machine learning to optimise the performance of motorways, arterials, and ramps in cities, by predicting future traffic patterns and proactively responding to them. This will help create a more efficient transportation network for the movement of goods and people between urban and suburban areas within a city, for work and leisure. The project will model the road network and seek to optimise travel time proactively tailored to and tested with Melbourne datasets.
