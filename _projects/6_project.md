Spatial data - data with location information - is being generated at an unprecedented rate as sensors become more ubiquitous. It is critical for location-based services, transportation, urban planning, and emergency management. However, using this data is constrained by outdated methods currently used, which are difficult to adapt with the emerging querying needs of non-expert users. By investigating querying methods that self-optimise for emerging query types, this project aims to develop next-generation spatial database systems with enhanced query capability and accessibility. Project outcomes will prepare Australia for emerging applications such as mixed reality and establish our leadership in the global geospatial analytics market.
