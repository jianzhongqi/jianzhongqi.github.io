This project aims to design novel spatial data retrieval methods for efficient and accurate querying of large datasets with location information. Spatial data is being generated at an unprecedented rate due to the prevalence of mobile devices and ubiquitous connectivity. However, harnessing this data is hampered by outdated and inefficient methods. The project will investigate data retrieval methods that self-optimise for high query efficiency and accuracy, by utilising underlying real-world data patterns. It will enable novel applications for virtual spatial systems with large-scale querying needs, such as spatial digital twins and metaverses, benefiting location-based service providers, urban planners, and emergency management agencies.
