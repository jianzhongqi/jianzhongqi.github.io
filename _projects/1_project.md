This project aims to design novel algorithms for aligning and querying of spatial data from heterogeneous sources. Spatial data is being generated at an unprecedented rate due to the prevalence of mobile devices and ubiquitous connectivity, which enables a novel application, spatial digital twins. However, harnessing this data in spatial digital twins is hampered by the isolation of data from different sources. The project will investigate algorithms to align and query spatial data from heterogeneous sources for high accessibility. It will enable novel applications with advanced spatial analytical querying needs, such as emergency planning, benefiting location-based service providers, urban planners, and emergency management agencies.
